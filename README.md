# Portfolio
This portfolio repository contains several projects I've worked on and find interesting.

# Contents
* A-Star Pathfinding visualisation: A visualisation tool for the A-Star pathfinding algorithm, implemented in Python and Pygame.

* CAPM Verifier: A tool for verifying the validity of the investement portfolios using Capital Asset Pricing Model and historical prices data. It was implemented in Python using Streamlit. The tool was made with the thought of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Main Market. 

* Sentiment Analysis ML: A machine learning model for sentiment analysis of text data, implemented in Python using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn.

* Trading Charts Plotter: This is still a work in progress.

Each project has its own folder, which contains its source code and any necessary files. Additionally, each project folder has its own README file, providing more information about the project.

# In Progress
* Tweak the Sentiment Analysis model. Current version has around 0.99 R Score for the positive sentiment and around 0.70 for the negative ones. 
* Add features to the Trading Charts Plotter. Such as live data plotting, switching between different financial instruments/indicators etc. I'd also love to add some trading signals based on some strategies with backtesting.
* New projects

# Acknowledgments
* A-Star Visualiser was inspired by Tech With Tim's tutorial on A-Star pathfinding in Python and Pygame.

* CAPM Verifier was inspired by my financial engineering professor and a dear friend of mine. 

* Sentiment Analysis ML was inspired by the controversy surrounding the Hogwarts Legacy game. Shoutout to the Kaggle community for providing the .csv file with the data to analyze.
